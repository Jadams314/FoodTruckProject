truck has the highest information.


### Topics and Technologies Used
* Multiple classes
* Arrays
* For Loops
* Switches
* Getters/Setters
* non static Methods


### How to Run

Paste the code from both classes into a text editor capable of reading java.
Save both claases
Run the class the FoodTruck App

### Lessons Learned
Write out what I want to do first before I start coding. Break down the problem into smaller ones
and handle them one at a time.
I learned how to use an array to store information from multiple objects. I Leared how to iterate through an
array to get the information I need.
